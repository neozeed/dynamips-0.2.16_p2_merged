What's New since v0.2.15
========================

    - Add instructions to build on Windows.
    - Remove libuuid dependency and NIO Multicast implementation that depends on it. NIO Multicast is never used and maybe not even functional. This will simplify the compilation requirements, especially on Windows with Cygwin.
    - EthernetSwitch: Allow to choose ethertype for QinQ outer tag.
